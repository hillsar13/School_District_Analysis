# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis:
The purpose of the initial and broader analysis was to calculate the performance of math & reading scores on a summary & district level. After initial analysis, the school board reported evidence of academic dishonesty by the 9th grade population at Thomas High School. The following outcome and discission is the repeated analysis omitting the scores of the fradulant academic school/grade.

## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following?:

### Math and reading scores by grade
The Math and Reading scores by grade are largely unimpacted as we only removed the values for the 9th grade class from Thomas High School, so averages across other grade levels would remain the same. However, the overall Math & Reading score percentages are impacted. 

### Scores by school spending
