# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis:
The purpose of the initial and broader analysis was to calculate the performance of math & reading scores on a summary & district level. After initial analysis, the school board reported evidence of academic dishonesty by the 9th grade population at Thomas High School. The following outcome and discission is the repeated analysis omitting the scores of the fradulant academic school/grade.

## How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Following repeated analysis, Thomas High School still remains in the 2nd place spot for overall performance. However, the Overall % dropped from 90.94% to 90.63%, with a mere .04% difference between that and the 3rd place spot: Griffin High School. 

## How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following?:

### Math and reading scores by grade
The Math and Reading scores by grade are largely unimpacted as we only removed the values for the 9th grade class from Thomas High School, so averages across other grade levels would remain the same. However, the overall Math & Reading score percentages are impacted. 

## Scores by school spending

Following repeated analysis, the spending bracked '$630 - 644' reflected decreased percentages in Average Math, Passing Math, Passing Reading, and Overall Pass.

## Scores by school size

Following repeated analysis, the 'Medium' school size (1000-2000) reflected decreased percentages in Average Math, Passing Math, Passing Reading, and Overall Pass.

Following repeated analysis, the Charter School column  reflected decreased percentages in Average Math, Passing Math, Passing Reading, and Overall Pass.


# Summary: 
## There are numerous takeaways from the repeated analysis, largely reflected in the marginal statistical differences in the initial and repeated analysis. Here are 4 highlightable points:

- Repeated Analysis led to a decrease in Average Math Scores
- Repeated Analysis led to an increase in Average Reading Scores
- Repeated Analysis led to a decrease total % of individuals passing Math & Reading
- Repeated Analysis led to a decrease total % of overall passing 

Albeit small, the removal of the 9th grade class at Thomas High School led to poorer performance by the school in all almost all elements (District Level, School Level, and specified School testing). They were able to maintain their 2nd place finish in the top 5 schools, but were mere decimal points away from thr 3rd place school, Griffin. There school board can take into consideration the mere percentile differences caused by this change on broader budgeting recommendation. As a whole, the outcome of the data state was largely unimpacted, reflecting strong Reading perforamnce, seconded by Math performance, and lowested in overall performance. The spending per student bins on the lower end (<$584 & $585 - $629) performed better academicallt than the high eng ($630 - $644 & $645 - $675). Medium sized, Charter schools also highlighted the largest acedmic success. Continual analysis over time can provide detailed information for school board decisions.
